The delivery executive arrived without wearing a helmet, and critically, was not carrying a standard, sealed Swiggy food delivery bag.

I didn't even place any order just had my cart filled and they just asked for my address and then order got placed by itself and God knows why they removed the cancelling timing they used to give. They didn't cancel the order and when I called them then they blocked my cod option and gave me a fine of ₹251 on next order. Don't use Swiggy as Instamart is also bad nowadays. Bycot Swiggy !

For 20mins order not assigned a delivery guy for 1.5 hours and finally cancelled the orde, on their own without customer knowledge. With so much inflated prices, still the service is utterly poor.

After ordering the food from Freshmenu Hesarghatta road almost an hour later I am getting a call from the delivery agent who is a good for nothing named Anvith and Team leader somasekhar that the restaurant is closed .When I insisted on talking to the supervisor it wasn't done after putting me on hold for multiple times.They WASTED another 1 hour of mine and shut us by cancelling our own order and processing a refund.Online ticket wasn't even raised for the concern.,0,4.94.0,25-10-2025 17:20,"Hey there, please drop an email at swiggysocial@swiggy.in with your order ID, it will help us get this checked and get back to you with an apt resolution.",25-10-2025 17:22,Swiggy,2025,10,Negative,Rider Misbehavior,,,Poor Customer Support,,,

Merging orders of different locations so that delivery partner can't deliver on time. If we reach for support they will assist you with a chat bot. For a 3 km restaurant it has taken 1 hour 30 mins for delivery. Replacing humans with chatbots is not a solution. Your chatbot increase frustration instead of giving solution. Improve your services and don't advertise we will deliver in minutes and all.,2,19.2.4,31-10-2025 09:51,,,Zomato,2025,10,Negative,Delivery Delay,,App Technical Issue,Poor Customer Support,,,

The support chat is absolutely useless and show a few limited options of their own choosing. Lets not even talk about delivery- there have been times where they said estimated delivery time is 50mins and the order was delivered 2hrs later. Also they show higher prices even for fast food chains as compared to the app for that particular chain.,176,19.2.2,28-10-2025 05:46,,,Zomato,2025,10,Negative,Delivery Delay,Poor Food Quality,App Technical Issue,Poor Customer Support,High Prices,,
